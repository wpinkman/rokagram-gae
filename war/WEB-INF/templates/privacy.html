				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p>
					Last updated: May 5, 2016 <br> <br> <strong><span
						style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Policy</span>:</strong> <br> <br>
					Welcome to the web site (the "Site") of Rokagram, Inc.
					("Rokagram", "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by
					Rokagram and has been created to provide information about our
					company and its information sharing services (the "Services") to our
					registered users ("you", "your"). This Privacy Policy sets forth
					Rokagram's policy with respect to information including
					personally identifiable data ("Personal Data") and other information
					that is collected from Site visitors and users of the Services.<br>
					<br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information
							We Collect</span>:</strong> <br> <br> When you interact with us through
					the Site or the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other
					information from you, as further described below:<br> <br>
					<strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site: </strong>We
					collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such
					information such as when you link your Instagram account to your Roku device,
					or contact us with inquiries or respond to our
					surveys. Wherever Rokagram collects Personal Data we make an
					effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. <br> <br>
					<strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you
						are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy
						Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree
						that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current
						location to the offices and servers of Rokagram and the
						authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United
						States.</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Non-Identifiable or
						Aggregated Data: </strong>When you interact with Rokagram through the
					Site or Roku channel, we receive and store certain personally
					non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected
					passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to
					specifically identify you. Rokagram may store such information
					itself or such information may be included in databases owned and
					maintained by Rokagram affiliates, agents or service providers.
					This Site may use such information and pool it with other
					information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to
					our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the
					domain names of our visitors&#8217; Internet service providers, and
					how our users use and interact with the Rokagram Service. Also,
					in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the
					Services, Rokagram often conducts research on its customer
					demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and
					other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and
					analyzed on an aggregate basis. Rokagram may share this
					non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and
					business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate
					information does not identify you personally. Rokagram may also
					disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our
					services to current and prospective business partners, and to other
					third parties for other lawful purposes. <br> <br> In
					operating this Site, we may also use a technology called
					&#8220;cookies.&#8221; A cookie is a piece of information that the
					computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access
					the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the
					Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance,
					our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access
					the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more
					than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use
					cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your
					permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on
					the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to
					receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to
					turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on
					because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's
					features.<br> <br> <strong><span
						style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Use of Your Personal
							Data and Other Information</span>:</strong> <br> <br> Rokagram
			uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent
			with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain
			reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason
			for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email,
			we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or
			resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to
			obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to
			provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of
			such services. Rokagram and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the
			"Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other
			personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to
			help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better
			understand our users and to improve the Services. Rokagram and its
			Related Companies may use this information to communicate with you
			regarding the Services or to tell you about services we believe will
			be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we
			send you will contain instructions permitting you to
			&#8220;opt-out&#8221; of receiving future marketing communications.
			Note however that as a user of the Service you cannot opt-out of some
			administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the
			Service, such as billing or service notifications. In addition, if at
			any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you
			wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact
			us as indicated below.<br> <br>
					If Rokagram intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that
					is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of
					such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal
					Data is collected.<br> <br> <strong><span
						style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Disclosure of Your
							Personal Data and Other Information</span>:</strong> <br> <br>
					Rokagram is not in the business of selling your information. We
					consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship
					with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may
					share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further
					notice to you, as set forth below:<br> <br> <strong>Business
						Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy
					businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
					reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be
					part of the transferred assets. <br> 
					<br> <strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third
						Parties:</strong> Rokagram, like many businesses, sometimes hires other
					companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of
					such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases
					and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a
					function of this nature, we only provide them with the information
					that they need to perform their specific function. <br> <br>
					<strong>Legal Requirements: </strong>Rokagram may disclose your
					Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith
					belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal
					obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of
					Rokagram, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the
					personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect
					against legal liability. <br> <br> <strong><span
						style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Choices</span>:</strong> <br>
					<br> You can use the Site and Roku channel without providing any Personal Data.
					If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able
					to use certain Services.<br> <br> <strong><span
						style="text-decoration: underline;">Exclusions</span>:</strong> <br> <br>
					This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by
					Rokagram other than Personal Data collected through the Site or
					Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited
					information you provide to Rokagram through this Site or through
					any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information
					posted to any public areas of the Site, such as bulletin boards
					(collectively, "Public Areas"), any ideas for new products or
					modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited
					submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"). All
					Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and
					Rokagram shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute
					and exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or
					attribution.<br> <br> <strong><span
						style="text-decoration: underline;">Children</span>:</strong> <br> <br>
					Rokagram does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children
					under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not
					submit any Personal Data through the Site. We encourage parents and
					legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to
					help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never
					to provide Personal Data on this Site without their permission. If
					you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has
					provided Personal Data to Rokagram through this Site, please
					contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our
					databases.<br> <br> <strong><span
						style="text-decoration: underline;">Links to Other Web Sites</span>:</strong>
					<br> <br> This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site.
					This Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or
					controlled by Rokagram (the "Third Party Sites"). The policies
					and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party
					Sites. The links from this Site do not imply that Rokagram
					endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest
					contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy
					policies.<br> <br> <strong><span
						style="text-decoration: underline;">Security</span>:</strong> <br> <br>
					Rokagram takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data
					provided via the Site from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
					disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email
					or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free,
					so you should take special care in deciding what information you
					send to us in this way.<br> <br> <strong><span
						style="text-decoration: underline;">Changes to Rokagram's
							Privacy Policy</span>:</strong> <br> <br> The Site and our business may
					change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary
					for Rokagram to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Rokagram
					reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any
					time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this
					policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal
					Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated
					above. Your continued use of the Site after any changes or revisions
					to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms
					of such revised Privacy Policy.<br> <br> <strong><span
						style="text-decoration: underline;">Access to Information;
							Contacting Rokagram</span>:</strong> <br> <br> To keep your Personal
					Data accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as specified
					below. We will take reasonable steps to update or correct Personal
					Data in our possession that you have previously submitted via this
					Site or Services.<br> <br> Please also feel free to

					Policy or the information practices of this Site by emailing us at
